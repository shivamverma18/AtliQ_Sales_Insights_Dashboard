## 🧩 Problem Statement

The Sales Director at AtliQ Technologies struggled with limited visibility into key sales data across markets, customers, and products. Manual efforts in data gathering consumed valuable analyst time and led to delays in decision-making. This project solves that challenge by building a fully automated sales dashboard using Tableau, enabling fast, data-driven insights.
